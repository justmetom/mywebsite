<h4>
3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h4>
I found Trello helpful in planning my project, but given the time restraints on the 
project, and my slow typing skills, I found I spent almost as much time updating 
Trello as I did on the actual writing and coding. While I hesitate to blame my 
tools, the borrowed laptop I used for this project was very old and slow. Faster 
equipment would have made a difference, as would me having more experience using 
basic computer skills.  While it is nice to wholly own what you create, working in 
a team does have some advantages. It is good to have other people to bounce ideas off 
or to be able
to ask for help with something.

<h4>    3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4>
Technical issues aside, there are other ways to improve productivity and efficiency. 
Taking regular breaks away from your screen is helpful. It gives your eyes a rest 
and can also stop you getting stuck on one little thing, especially if it is not 
working well. Keeping fed and hydrated are important as is building a little 
physical activity, such as the yoga sessions a Code Nation into your work routine. 

    
<h4>    3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in 
    digital projects</h4>
    The most important thing I could do to increase my productivity is to practice 
    my computer skills (typing etc.) and to practice coding.  A faster computer, 
    less prone to go-slow would improve productivity. While working in a team can 
    involve more talking as well as doing, I think having people to bounce ideas off 
    and to ask for help if you need it can lead to better productivity. There is 
    less chance of one small issue holding up the whole project if there are others
    you can call on for help.

 <h4>   3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h4>
It can be hard, once a project you have been immersed in is finally complete, 
to always spot any mistakes that might have occurred. There is a tendency to 
just see what you expect to see. For this reason it is always a good idea to 
get someone else to go over your final work. They are more able to spot mistakes 
and give constructive criticism.
