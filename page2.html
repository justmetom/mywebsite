    My name is Tom Neumann. I was made redundant from my job shortly
    <br>before the Coronavirus lockdown. 
    
    I found myself unexpectedly 
    unemployed,<br> which was a new experience.
    I was looking for something interesting 
    
    to keep<br> me occupied while I searched for a new job.       
    <br>
    Prior to starting the Develop Coding course at Code Nation, I had very 
    little<br> experience of working with IT. 
    My working career has mostly been 
    spent 
    <br>
    working outdoors or in warehouses or care homes, and so very 
    
    rarely<br> involved any use of computer skills at all. So being on the course at 
    <br>
    Code Nation has been a very 
    steep learning curve, not just the coding 
    <br>
    but also getting to grips with using a computer generally.  I have been
    <br>
    thinking of a change in career, though if I am honest IT was not 
    <br>
    at the top 
    of the list of options. However 
    
    since being on the course 
    <br>
    I do see new 
    possibilities. Even if it does not lead to a new career, I will 
    <br>
    continue to code.
