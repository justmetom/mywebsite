    1.5 Copyright and other Constraints affecting Websites</h4>
   <p>
      Copyright gives the holder exclusive rights to their original work. Any 
      unautherised use of this work (it can be images, designs or text) is an 
      infringement. Website designers need to be careful when using content from
      elsewhere on the internet, it is not always obvious what is free to use and 
      what is protected. GDPR affects the collection, storing and using of personal 
      data. Equality laws regulate the accessabilty of websites.

      <h4>Unit 2, 1.6 Access issues that need taking into account</h4>
      <p>
      It is in the interest of website designers that their websites should be 
      accessable to everyone. This means including such assistive technologies as 
      screen magnifiers, screen readers or speech recognition tools in your
      build. Look at the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG20) issued 
      by the Web Accesiblity Initiative (WAI).

      <h4>Unit 2, 1.7 Which are the appropriate file types for websites</h4>
      <p>
      Different file types support one or more forms of content, such as text, 
      images or video. They each have their advantages and disadvantages, 
      depending what you are using them for. For this project I am mostly using 
      HTML for text, CSS for styling and JPEG, PNG and GIF for images.
