<h4> Unit 1, Outcome 1

<br>
<br>
   1.1: The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h4>
 
 IT is an essentioal part of modern business. All businesses, big 
 or small use it. 
 IT is used by business to make it easier to, store, 
 retrieve, manage and use information and to facilitate 
 communication with customers and staff. It can be used to 
 keep competitive information private.

 <h4> 1.2: The Methods, Skills and Resources needed to complete Digital 
     Projects successfully   </h4>
  
  A successful project starts with planning. 
  What are you trying to achieve, how are you going to go about it. 
  What do you need? Use something like Trello to keep track and on schedule.  
  Research your project subject, in this case look at how websites/blogs are 
  created and used.
  Resources are what you will need for your project and include such things as 
  people, equipment, space and funding. 
  The skills needed to successfully complete the project will include the ability 
  to work well with others, as well as on your own. Good communication is vital. 
  While the ability to stay focused on the task at hand is important, flexibility 
  is needed to be able to deal with any problems should they arise,
  and they usually do however well you have planned.

 <h4>  1.3: Planning and Carrying out Tasks using IT </h4>
 
     Planning is key to successful completion of any project no 
     matter what its size. Use a system like Kanban and a tool such as Trello to keep track 
     of what needs doing, what is being done and what is complete. 
     Also, of who in your team (if you have one) is doing what. A 
     flow chart can be useful in the initial stages to sketch the 
     steps needed to get to your desired outcome.

 <h4> 1.4: What are the Risks that might impact Digital Projects </h4>
 
 Large projects might have more risks attached than small ones, such as having 
 to deal with multiple outside contractors or stakeholders, but some risks are 
 common to all projects. The biggest risk that might impact on your digital 
 project is lack of planning. Not all risks can be planned for, but project risks 
 should be a part of your initial planning as much as possible. Examples of 
 risks that can be planned for include;
 - schedule risk, bottlenecks that can hold up the entire project
 - resource risk, lack of skilled staff for example or proor equipment
 - budget risk, over runs or budget being cut
 Things that might impact your project but be hard to plan for might include;
 - war 
 - natural disasters
 - changes in legal requirements
 - even a little thing like the wi-fi being down can throw you ofF schedule

 <h4> 1.5: Selecting and Using IT Systems and Software</h4>
 
     Selecting the right software and tools to use for your project 
     is an important part of the planning process. If starting from 
     scratch I would look at first the cost - is the return worth the 
     investment? Usability is important - are you and/or your team 
     familiar and comfortable with the systems and tools you are using? 
     Research what other teams are using for similar projects. Use a 
     comparison site such as <a href = http://www.softwareadvice.com/about-us/ ></a> or
     <a href = https://www.g2crowd.com/ ></a>

 <h4> 1.6: Analysis of how your chosen Technologies have have helped you achieve your outcomes </h4>
 
 I have used Trello to help keep my project on track. It shows me what is complete,
 what is currently being done, and what is still to do. Git is a version control 
 system (VCS) hosted on GitHub. 
 I haven't had to use it yet, but once the website is live i can use it to keep 
 track of any changes I might want to make at a later date.
