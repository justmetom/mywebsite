    <h4>Unit 1, Outcome 2
    <br>
    <br>
  1.1 Review the on going use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h4> 
    <p>
    The tools I have mostly been using are Trello, and Visual Studio Code. 
    I have found Trello useful for planning my project and to help me keep 
    track of what needs doing when. However never having really used a tool 
    like Trello it took a while to get used to, and I found it easy to forget 
    to update it. With a small solo project like this one that is maybe ok, but 
    with a bigger one and more people it would be more important. Visual Studio 
    Code is the only code editor I have ever used, so I cannot compare it to 
    others, but it worked well for me.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
   <h4> 1.2 Describe whether the tools selected were appropriate.</h4>
   <p>
Trello worked well for me when I remembered to use it. Visual Studio Code 
did what it was supposed to. I have no experience of using other similar 
tools, so it is hard to judge whether something else would have worked better.

<h4> 1.3 Assess the strength and weakness of your final project</h4>
   
Given the limited time and practice we had to complete our projects I am 
    pleased with it. I ended up with something simpler and more basic than I 
    had envisioned at first, the visual styling of the website was a bit rushed, 
    but it met the requirements of the brief and I learned a lot and had fun doing it.
      
    <br>
    <br>
 <h4>   1.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h4>
    <p>
 If I had more time for the project and more time to practise coding I would
     improve on the visual style of the website. I would do more work on the layout
      and imagery and colouring to make it a little more interesting to view.
